\section{Exploring discrete log problem}

Take a seed, that is a member of $Z_p^x$.

Construct the following sequence of bits: 
MSB (x1) || MSB (x2) ... || MSB(x_i)


|| = concatenation
$x_j =  g^x_{j - 1}$ in $Z_p^x$


Given $(g^x mod p, p, g)$ what is the $MSB(x)$? Is this actually as tough
as trying to find $x$?


\subsection{Theorem: $LSB(x)$ is easy to get}
\subsubsection{Proof}


Fermat's little theorem: $\forall x \in Z_p^x, x^{p - 1} = 1$
\subsubsection{Proof of fermat's little theorem (raw number theory)}
Everything happens in x^{p - 1}.

$S = {a, 2a, 3a, ... (p - 1)a}$.
We show that this is a permutation of
$S' = {1, 2, 3, ..., (p - 1) }$

$a \neq 0$. So, $a \cdot x = 0 implies x = 0 since Z_p^x is integral domain$

Suppose two elements are not distinct in $S$. This means that $ai - aj = 0$
Hence, $p | a(i - j)$. But, $a < p$, $(i - j) < p$. Hence, their product 
cannot be divisible by $p$ (product of two numbers less than a prime numbers.


Multiplying all numbers in S should be equal to multiplying all numbers in S'


$a^(p - 1) (p - 1)! =(congruent mod p)= (p - 1)!$
Hence $a^(p - 1) =(congruent mod p)= 1$

\subsubsection{Continuing proof of LSB of discrete log is easy}

(g^x)^(p - 1) = 1
(g^x)^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} = +-1

When $x$ is even, this will be $+1$. When $x$ is odd, this will be $-1$

In some sense, we are computing (g^x|p) (legendre symbol)

Hence, we can find $LSB(x)$. Note that this will fail if $g^(p - 1)/2 = 1$,
but $g$ is a generator of $Z_p^x$ so it can't happen (g has order |p - 1|).


\subsection{Can we not use this to "peel bits" off?}

If $4 | p - 1$, then we can reapply the same method to get *two* bits.


g^x^\frac{p - 1}{4} = 
1. if x == 0 mod 4 -> 1
2. if x == 1 mod 4 -> ?
3. if x == 2 mod 4 -> ?
4. if x == 3 mod 4 -> ?
